# Basics of scss/sass

This project is too basic for most people, you might find it interesting how I've setup the live-server and scss processing with just one command.

## How to use

`npm install` - to install all necessary packages for the setup to run.

`npm run dev` - runs live server and processes scss down to css with watch mode.
