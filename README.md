# Completed Courses

I pulled out the notes from the big front-end development courses I've completed into their repo, as my other private repo was getting big, disorganized and bloated. From now on, all big or notable course notes will be pushed here.

Completed courses (oldest to newest):

- JS30 - 30 projects in 30 days - Wes Bos
- ES6 For everyone - Wes Bos
- Modern JavaScript From The Beginning - Brad Traversy
- Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)
