# What is the stack?

The stack is the assigned memory used to store code data, this data has an enforced order.
Each new command is added to the top and each new execution is taken from the bottom.

- When data is taken out of the stack it's called popping.

# What is the heap?

Heap is dynamic memory set aside for dynamic allocation. This memory doesn't
have execution pattern like the stack.
